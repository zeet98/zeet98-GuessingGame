/**
 * This service class is intended to contain the basic logic for playing the number guessing game.
 * Separating menu logic and game logic is good for two reasons: it makes both classes as simple
 * as they could be, and it also makes this class capable of being tested with automated tests, since testing
 * a class that receives user input is difficult. If the logic of the game were to become more complicated,
 * the advantages of separating code in this way will become immediately apparent. You will see this in the
 * coming mini-projects.
